# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to build a predictive model that determines whether a patient is likely to have diabetes. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, class balancing, model training, and evaluation — all done in Google Colab using Python.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Predicts diabetes based on diagnostic health data
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Balanced imbalanced classes with undersampling
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models
- Visualized performance using confusion matrix and classification report

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
  - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- **Google Colab**
- **Machine Learning**
  - Classification (Binary)
  - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Size:** 768 rows × 9 columns
- **Features:** Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
- **Target:** Outcome (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes)

---

## ✅ Results

- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy:** ~75%
- **Key Features:** Glucose, BMI, Age
- **Evaluation:** Balanced F1-score with clean confusion matrix

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Experiment with advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, SVM)
- Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
