# üß† Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to build a predictive model that determines whether a patient is likely to have diabetes. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, class balancing, model training, and evaluation ‚Äî all done in Google Colab using Python.

## üîç Project Overview

- Predicts diabetes based on diagnostic health data
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Balanced imbalanced classes with undersampling
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models
- Visualized performance using confusion matrix and classification report

## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Size:** 768 rows √ó 9 columns
- **Features:** Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
- **Target:** Outcome (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes)

---

## ‚úÖ Results

- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy:** ~75%
- **Key Features:** Glucose, BMI, Age
- **Evaluation:** Balanced F1-score with clean confusion matrix

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Experiment with advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, SVM)
- Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

## üìà Visualizations

### 1. Age Distribution by Diabetes Outcome
![Age by Diabetes](images/age-by-diabetes)
- This boxplot highlights age distribution across diabetes outcomes. Individuals diagnosed with diabetes tend to be older on average.

### 2. Class Distribution Before and After SMOTE
![Before and After SMOTE](images/before-after-smote)
- SMOTE was applied to address class imbalance. After SMOTE, the dataset has equal representation of diabetic and non-diabetic cases, which helps improve model performance.

### 3. Feature Importance in Diabetes Prediction
![Feature Importance](images/prediction-diabetes)
- Glucose level was the most important feature in predicting diabetes, followed by BMI and Age.

  ### 4. Confusion Matrix
![Confusion Matrix](images/confusion-matrix)
- This confusion matrix visually summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for "Non-Diabetic" and "Diabetic" cases.

  ### 5. Diabetes & Pregnancy
![Pregnancies](images/pregnancies)
- This histogram visually represents the frequency distribution of the 'Pregnancies' variable, indicating how many times each number of pregnancies occurs in the dataset.

  ### 6. ROC Curve
![ROC Curve](images/ROC-curve)
- This ROC Curve, with an AUC of 0.81, demonstrates the model's strong ability to correctly classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic within the project's dataset.
